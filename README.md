<h1>Advanced Mobile Product Analysis and Interactive Chatbot System</h1>
In this project, I have undertaken a comprehensive task that involves sophisticated web scraping of mobile products from daraz.pk, data storage, and the development of an advanced chatbot. The project is focus on extracting detailed information about mobile products, creating an intelligent chatbot for user interaction, and presenting the data through an insightful and interactive dashboard.

<h3>Webscraping</h3>
- **Objective:** Extract mobile product data from daraz.pk, specifically from the first five pages.
- **Example:** Using Selenium or BeautifulSoup, I have written a script to navigate to the mobile phone section of daraz.pk. The script then parses through the HTML of each page, extracting product details such as name, price, brand, and reviews. For instance, if a product is named "Samsung Galaxy S21," the script extracts its price, specifications, and user reviews.
- **Extracted essential information:** I have extracted product ID, name, price, and company details. Additionally, I have retrieved reviews for each product, including review ID, score, and content.
- **Data Storage:** The extracted product details and reviews are stored in separate files (excel or csv), each uniquely identified with an ID.
- **Key Focus:** Filtering out irrelevant products has been achieved by setting conditions to exclude listings containing keywords like "case," "cover," or "charger."
